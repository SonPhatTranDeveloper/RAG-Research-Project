[{"text": "The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits\nMaximize shareholder welfare, not market value Maximizing welfare Shareholder rights Summary\nAppendix  \n34\n36\n39\n39  \nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing at its core seeks to contribute assets to companies which are pursuing ESG goals, or to influence companies to do so. But some question to what degree companies should pursue nonfinancial goals. One of the most important writings on the purpose of a firm is Milton Friedman\u2019s \u201cThe social responsibility of business is to increase its profits\u201d (Friedman, 1970). The majority of corporate executives, boards, and investment managers still agree with Friedman\u2019s view but after 50 years, many others think that this is not the whole answer. In this chapter, we will discuss Friedman\u2019s important paper and go on to look at competing views.", "source": "data/markdowns/text/Chapter_3.md", "location": 0}, {"text": "First, Friedman takes issue with discussions of the \u201csocial responsibilities of business.\u201d He points out that this is too vague, that inanimate constructs like corporations don\u2019t have responsibilities. It is people, proprietors, or corporate executives, who have responsibilities, and their fundamental responsibility is to conduct their business activities in accordance with the desires of their owners/employers. This means they will undertake \u201cto make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom\u201d (Friedman, 1970). He notes that some corporations, for example, hospitals, might have an additional objective of providing certain levels of service. His point here is that the firm\u2019s managers are responsible to the owners of the corporation. These employees are free to support charitable or social activities on their own time, with their own income and wealth but have no basis to take it upon themselves to divert corporate resources to these purposes. Such an action would be taking money from others. It would reduce shareholder returns or if these expenditures were funded by raising sales prices, it would siphon off customers\u2019 money. Shareholders and customers are, of course, always free to spend their own money on any cause as they see fit and, in this view, these are the appropriate sources of funding for charitable and social causes. A related question is to what extent corporate charitable acts might \u201ccrowd out\u201d private contributions. One way to view employee spending on social activities is that they would be \u201ctaxing\u201d shareholders and customers, and employees would be deciding on their own where \u201cexpenditures\u201d of these tax dollars should go. But, Friedman points out, we have established elaborate governmental procedures to determine taxes and expenditures: democratic elections; elaborate checks and balances; executive, legislative, and judicial arms; federal, state, and local powers; important constitutional protections; and massive regulatory procedures. Imperfect as it may be, all this apparatus would be overturned or circumvented by a business manager, selfselected or appointed by a board of directors, who deems themselves simultaneously legislator, government executive, and jurist in pursuit of a specific social goal. Friedman goes further to consider that the corporate executive is hired to be an agent in promoting the interests of the owners of the corporation. To the extent that the executive departs from that goal in an attempt to further social purposes, then they become (unelected, unnominated, and unconfirmed) de facto public employees. Further questions arise as to how does the employee know how much to spend and how to spend it? How do they know what action to take to meet a specific social goal? What are the appropriate cost shares to assign to employees, shareholders, and customers? Many who support corporations\u2019 social activism do so only to the extent that their own preferences are aligned with those specific activities. However, they are less supportive or even critical of corporate activism which is at odds with their beliefs. So, it is not corporate social responsibility per se that they support, but instead it\u2019s the backing of specific causes that are important to them.  \nFriedman goes on to address the complaint that political and legislative processes are often too slow to address pressing social problems. He finds this argument objectionable in principle in that those who make this assertion have failed to persuade a majority of fellow citizens of their position and are nonetheless seeking to make an undemocratic claim of their validity. This argument also applies to activist stockholder proposals whereby a minority seek to impose their desire for favored causes on the company when those causes have consistently failed to attract support of a majority of the holders. And this is not a sterile debate from the 1970s. For example, large institutional investors are currently engaged with gun manufacturers on the issues of firearm manufacturing, sales and safety. As recently as March 2018, gunmaker American Outdoor Brands Corporation (formerly Smith and Wesson) posted a reply to these investors on its company website (Monheit and Debney, 2018):  \n\u201cWe do not believe that our stockholders associate the criminal use of a firearm with the company that manufactures it. We do believe, however, that there would be far greater reputational and financial risk to our company if we were to manufacture and market products containing features that consumers of our products do not desire, or if we were to take political positions with which consumers of our products do not agree.\u201d Though the company respects the current national gun-control debate, \u201cthe solution is not to take a politically motivated action that has an adverse impact on our company, our employees, our industry, our shareholders, the economies we support and, significantly, the rights of our law-abiding customers, but results in no increase in public safety.\u201d The company does, however, support greater enforcement of current laws and efforts to improve background checks.  \nAfter Friedman, a second influential paper is \u201cTheory of the firm: managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure\u201d (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). This paper provides a useful explanation for many corporate activities from the \u201cagency-principal\u201d perspective. In this model the principals (shareholders) cede decision making authority to agents (boards of directors and corporate managers). This delegation creates a generic problem which arises in many different arenas. The issue is that it is difficult for the principals to ensure that the agents act strictly in accordance with the best outcomes for the principals. Jensen and Meckling\u2019s analysis forms a basis for subsequent discussions of how to mitigate the agency problem using strategies such as establishing appropriate incentives for the agent and developing, at a cost, adequate monitoring solutions. Applying these concepts in the context of a firm\u2019s socially responsible actions, agent activities, and expenses not designed to enhance shareholder value would cause a loss of welfare to the principals.  \nProfit maximization has the virtue of being relatively simple, easy to understand, and easy to measure. Having other social purposes as goals leads to a risk of unintended, adverse outcomes. For example, here\u2019s one observer\u2019s interpretation of the demise of the failed blood testing company, Theranos:  \nI just finished reading John Carreyrou\u2019s \u201cBad Blood,\u201d the story of the fraud at Theranos Inc. and his work to uncover it. Theranos\u2014in Carreyrou\u2019s view, and the view of federal prosecutors\u2014issued tens of thousands of blood-test results to real patients using technology that it knew didn\u2019t work, endangering those patients\u2019 lives. There are a lot of passages in the book about Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes inspiring and cajoling her employees to work harder, to get with the mission, to override their moral objections to faking the technology and push ahead. None of those passages mention shareholder value or profit maximization. They mention Holmes\u2019s vision of revolutionizing health care to save lives and treat cancer patients. If you want to inspire people to do terrible things, it is very useful to sell them on a grand vision, a higher purpose, a noble mission (emphasis added).  \nMost of this chapter\u2019s discussion centers on the shortcomings of firms which focus only on maximizing profits or shareholder value. Levine\u2019s observations regarding Theranos point out the other side of the coin: a company may use a cloak of a grand vision while engaging in socially undesirable activities and being unprofitable at the same time.  \nActions taken solely to effect social goals shouldn\u2019t be confused with similar actions which on the surface might seem to be altruistic, but in fact are designed to further corporate profitability. For example, an employer might provide amenities to a community such as paying for cleaning subways or ridding highways of litter. These \u201cgood will\u201d activities can enhance the company\u2019s reputation and make it easier to attract employees or enhance a brand\u2019s image. But they are not germane to the question of a firm\u2019s more pervasive social responsibility. This kind of activity, promoting the company as environmentally or socially responsible but with little commitment, is sometimes called \u201cgreenwash.\u201d  \nFriedman\u2019s theory is based on an idealistic belief in the inherent value of freedom of individual choices and of democratic government principles. He rejects the imposition (\u201ccoercion\u201d) of artificial and ill-defined \u201csocial responsibility\u201d as subversive of these institutions. This continues to be the position of many even in today\u2019s age of increased sensitivity to social issues. For example, Phil Gram and Mike Solon (Gramm and Solon, 2018) write the following in the Wall Street Journal on July 19, 2018: \u201c. . .Arguments for imposing political and social objectives on business often are little more than rationalizations for forcing businesses to abide by values that have been rejected in Congress and the courts. . .America created the world\u2019s most successful economy by allowing private wealth to serve private economic objectives rather than political ones. The politicization of business decisions threatens to bring the massive inefficiencies of government into the private sector, cheating investors, workers and consumers in the process.\u201d", "source": "data/markdowns/text/Chapter_3.md", "location": 1}, {"text": "While Friedman\u2019s views are widely held, competing ideas have received increased attention. Some writers have taken the view that the modern corporation is as much a political adaptation as it is an economic or technological construct. Prior to the development in the 1970s of the view of the corporation as a nexus of contracts, particularly between shareholders and board members, there were interpretations of the firm as having corporate responsibilities to a wider group of constituents. Stakeholders are not just owners but also employees, customers, and the public at large. Another important stream of research looks at the firm from the point of view of property rights. Still others take issue with Friedman\u2019s theory on the basis that it too narrowly defines what it is that the owners of the business desire from their investment. Hart and Zingales (2017) argue that investors are not one-dimensional robots concerned only about monetary rewards. Yes, financial resources are important but individuals also have social and ethical concerns that do not end when evaluating corporate performance. Friedman makes the point that individuals should separate money-making activities from charitable acts which could be funded by those activities. But this separation argument assumes that individuals can gain the same scale and impact that a focused corporate action can have. Such is not always the case. Historically some corporate activities have resulted in significant negative social or environmental effects, but individuals acting on their own do not necessarily have the information, technology, or other resources to undo the damage. In these cases, having corporate involvement to address the negative effects might be the only credible solution. Government intervention either alone or with corporate participation is another alternative, although many agreeing with Friedman\u2019s profit maximizing argument would expect that corporate actions would be more efficient than government involvement.  \nIndividuals are subject to the negative effects of \u201cexternalities\u201d that may be generated by some corporate activities. Their welfare would be increased by direct corporate action to mitigate these externalities. In Friedman\u2019s idealized world, companies would simply make money and individuals and governments could use corporate income and taxes to address externalities. But Hart and Zingales argue that in many cases, money-making and ethical activities go hand in hand and are inseparable. They see Friedman\u2019s theory as requiring that consumers have scalable projects that are the mirror image of negative corporate activities. And further, that consumers receive enough funds to effect the offset, along with technology, information, communication, and other resources to bring this about. Clearly, this occurs rarely if ever. Government actions might be proposed as remedies but it\u2019s not obvious that focused government solutions can be provided efficiently in every instance. Nonseparable antisocial corporate activities are even more damning to Friedman\u2019s theory. The company\u2019s profit-making activities are intertwined with damaging results from those activities. And individuals do not have the technology, information, communication, and other resources to reverse the damaging results in a cost-effective manner. In this view, companies are better situated to address these issues.  \nFriedman\u2019s claim that government is the (sole) agent to effect social actions is also challenged. Laws and regulations don\u2019t necessarily cover every instance of desirable action. Even where there is the will to pass a law, the time it takes to gain enactment and enforcement can be excessive. And it may be more efficient for a business to act than for a government agency to be mobilized. The relative efficiency of corporate versus government action is surely supported by modern-day adherents to Friedman\u2019s theory.  \nThese counter arguments are clouded somewhat by Hart and Zingale\u2019s use of examples of social issues which are controversial and have yet to receive overwhelming public support. And if there is no well-defined standard for the level of support required, there is a risk of self-interested behavior by managers and boards. Socially responsible actions by a business may well be justifiable, but there are still unanswered questions of who decides what actions and what level of resources.", "source": "data/markdowns/text/Chapter_3.md", "location": 2}, {"text": "Stout (2013) makes the argument that boards and managers have latitude to maximize a wide array of possible objectives provided only that these actions themselves are legal and that they don\u2019t constitute a theft of corporate resources. She takes issue with the agent-principal analogy, noting that shareholder control is only indirect and in practice is difficult to exercise. Shareholders can replace boards, but this is rarely done. (A counter argument would be that this is rarely done because boards rarely act in an egregious manner. The threat of replacement and the recognition by the board of their responsibility to shareholders may act as a sufficient deterrent so as to make replacement unnecessary.) She notes that several strategies for shareholder profit maximization have been pursued in recent decades. Some of these strategies are as follows:  \nIncreasing the number of independent directors on the board.\nTying executive compensation more closely to stockholder profits, especially share price appreciation.\nRemove staggering of director terms so as to make it easier to replace these directors and thereby encourage accountability.  \nHave these strategies been successful in increasing shareholder profits? Empirical studies are mixed, but Stout finds that at times, these strategies for increasing shareholder value have not been successful in increasing investor returns. Further complicating managing toward a goal of shareholder profit maximization is the realization that shareholders are a diverse bunch with many different objectives. Some may want short-term maximum profits, but others may be in the stock for the long run, with a distant retirement objective. This latter group of shareholders would presumably approve forgoing current profits in order to expand investment programs with a longer run payoff. Other investors may have a strong opinion on social goals. For example, a union pension fund would presumably be opposed to an aggressive workforce reduction to improve short-term quarterly results. Shareholder value then is an artificial concept that is in practice impossible to define. Using short-term share price as the only metric for success results in privileging those shareholders \u201c. . .who are most shortsighted, opportunistic, undiversified, and indifferent to ethics or others\u2019 welfare.\u201d The desire to identify a single corporate purpose and optimize it may be appealing for its simplicity and for its usefulness when applying mathematics, but she thinks this is unrealistic and points out that many human activities pursue multiple objectives. For example, when eating a meal, we typically balance taste, healthfulness, and expense.  \nIn a dramatic letter to corporate heads (Fink, 2018), the CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager expressed the opinion that in managing their companies, corporate leaders need to have a broader perspective:  \n. . .society increasingly is turning to the private sector and asking that companies respond to broader societal challenges. Indeed, the public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.  \n. . .Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders. It will succumb to short-term pressures to distribute earnings, and, in the process, sacrifice investments in employee development, innovation, and capital expenditures that are necessary for long-term growth. It will remain exposed to activist campaigns that articulate a clearer goal, even if that goal serves only the shortest and narrowest of objectives. And ultimately, that company will provide subpar returns to the investors who depend on it to finance their retirement, home purchases, or higher education.  \nWhile Fink\u2019s letter was well received by many investors and corporate CEOs, it failed perhaps unsurprisingly to convince others with more traditional views. These latter investors point out the difficulty in identifying agreed social purposes and in measuring results. They also revert back to Friedman-esque arguments that the purpose of the firm is to maximize shareholder value, pay taxes, and allow governments to address social issues. One investor pointed out that many of Blackrock\u2019s funds are \u201cpassive\u201d and follow market indices (Lovelace, 2018). This investor believes it is inappropriate, even hypocritical for those funds to represent that they follow the market, but that fund management then says it will actively seek to influence decisions of those companies. Perhaps recognizing the difficulties in identifying appropriate social causes, this investor, himself an active philanthropist, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know Larry Fink had been made God.\u201d  \nIn Stout\u2019s view, firms can pursue a course of addressing multiple objectives and doing a credible job with each. This is then a \u201csatisficing\u201d rather than \u201cmaximizing\u201d strategy. By not seeking to \u201cmaximize\u201d the outcome of any one group to the detriment of others, managers would have less pressure to resolve conflict among shareholders, customers and employees. A reasonable, even desirable, management strategy is to generate significant profits for investors, but also to take into account additional desired outcomes championed by other company stakeholders. Long-term as well as short-term shareholders\u2019 interests are balanced; customers are well served; working conditions are such that employment opportunities are eagerly sought; regulations are complied with; and the firm is run in a socially responsible manner. Corporate profits are important but not the sole focus of management. Satisficing multiple objectives would seem to be a good description of management behavior of some of the best performing companies in the United States.", "source": "data/markdowns/text/Chapter_3.md", "location": 3}, {"text": "The preceding discussion concerns the appropriate actions of the managers and boards of a firm. But what about the shareholders? Shareholders are sometimes said to \u201cown\u201d a company. While shareholders have several important rights, they technically do not \u201cown\u201d a company, it owns itself. What rights do shareholders have? In general, they have the following rights:  \nThe right to receive dividends, as declared by the board and subject to the priority of preferred stockholders.\nGThe right to inspect certain corporate documents such as books and records.\nG A claim on assets in the event of bankruptcy.\nGRights to appraisal and access to certain information.\nGThe right to vote to elect, remove, or replace board members and to vote on certain corporate actions and other proposals.  \nAmong these, the right to vote may be the most important. By exercising their right to vote, investor/owners can affect corporate oversight, management, and actions. Roughly $85\\%$ of US companies have issued stocks which provide for a one-share, one-vote structure. However, voting rights are watered down by companies which issue dual-class shares with differential voting rights attached to each class. In terms of voting rights, not all shares are created equal. Typically, the founders and other corporate insiders will retain stock with \u201csuper\u201d voting rights which allow the founders to maintain voting control of the company. Stock issued to the public will have diluted voting rights. The most frequent voting ratio is for stock issued to founders, their families, and other insiders to have ten votes, while inferior shares have only one vote each. Some companies have dual-stock voting structures which are even worse than this. The dual-stock structure may have negative consequences in that it entrenches bad management unwilling to change its ways when the company fares poorly. But for a well-managed company it can also have the benefit of allowing forward thinking management to focus on longterm growth as opposed to merely maximizing this quarter\u2019s profits. Some examples of companies which have dual-class stock with skewed voting rights are Berkshire Hathaway, Ford, Facebook, and Alphabet. When Snap went public in 2017 it issued shares with no voting rights at all. The New York Stock Exchange for most of its existence would not list companies with dual-class voting rights. To compete with other exchanges with more liberal policies, it changed its rules and it now allows companies to initially list their shares in dual classes, but once they are listed the company cannot reduce the voting rights of existing shareholders or list new stock with super voting rights. More than $15\\%$ of the companies listed on US exchanges in 2015 had dual-class shares as opposed to only $1\\%$ in 2005.  \nResearch on the question of whether companies with dual classes of stock underperform their peers show mixed results. While there is some evidence that closely held companies have historically taken on excessive debt and that increased insider voting rights is associated with reduced firm value, the recent public listing of growing technology companies and changes in public and private capital markets structure has, however, muddied the waters. Managers of these technology companies have had more freedom to successfully pursue long range projects than they might have had if they were more beholden to quarterly performance metrics. But disagreeing on the potential value of dualclass stock, some institutional investors include \u201cone share, one vote\u201d as a positive governance factor. Also, FTSE Russell, one of the largest providers of equity indexes, notified companies in 2017 that it would include in its indexes only those companies with at least $5\\%$ of voting rights in the hands of the public. This seems to be a low bar, but it would exclude companies such as Snap, Virtu, Hyatt and 45 others. If the bar were set at $25\\%$ of voting rights in the hands of the public, 230 companies would be excluded. The Appendix to this chapter contains the list of these companies. For its part, S&P Dow Jones barred the addition of dual-stock companies from the S&P 500 and other indexes, although existing companies were grandfathered.  \nOne study (CFA, 2018) found the following from the history of dualstock listings in the United States and from reviewing several case studies:  \nThe current boom in dual-stock listings in the United States and in Asia is similar to the experience in the United States during the 1920s and 1980s, including increased liquidity and outsized optimism. The booms in the 1920s and 1980s were each followed by a prolonged period of market turmoil. The rise and fall (and rise again) of dual-stock listings is neither inevitable nor unique, and there are many more options than a wholesale adoption of dual-stock structures. Stock exchanges are feeling competitive pressures to allow dual-stock listings. GFor family businesses with a dual-stock structure, it is much easier for major shareholders to abuse their position and take advantage of public shareholders, either through massive executive compensation packages or questionable consultancy arrangements.  \nMajor shareholders (usually the founders) are not incentivized to maximize the company\u2019s potential. They may have voting control, but they have low equity ownership and few benefits accrue to them.  \nThe tension then is between founders\u2019 desire to maintain control and investors\u2019 desire for representation. A possible solution is to recognize that there may be some value in founders\u2019 keeping voting control in the early years of a company\u2019s life and growth, but to put a time limit on this structure. When the company is more mature, there are less grounds for arguing that super voting control should be in the hands of the founders\u2019 ancestors. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) studied the relative valuation of companies with dual classes of stock. One group of companies gave insiders control of the company forever, and a second group had \u201csunset\u201d  \n![](data/markdowns/images/Chapter_3/4370efea36e3c33623719cbaa30ca98b09cf589b6b3a53b501a0d2d4bb26f44a.jpg)\nFIGURE 3.1 Valuation of dual-class firms.
